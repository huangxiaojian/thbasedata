a very efficient small math library based on bullet

DISCLAIMER
------------
It is a **very efficient** small math library include *vector*, *matrix*, *quternion* and *transformation*, based on bullet. I implement all the operation in **SSE** and **AVX** which are more general than bullet.

Status
------------
Almost all the operations in vector and matrix are done in SIMD. But there remains some TODO in quternion and transformation.

If anyone with more experience than me has ideas on how to effectively improve the operations, please let me know. <huangxiaojian0401@gmail.com>

Building
------------
It is a VS2013 solution. But I think it is quite easy build on other platforms, like Linux and OSX.
